# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock
[Play the game with the very long title here!](https://besartelezi.github.io/rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock/)
## Small step for a programmer, but a big step for a programmer that isn't fluent (YET) in Javascript
The first step to this project, is adding the necessary HTML elements. This means:
* Buttons for all options: *Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock*
* Button that will start the game and let the computer pick his cards

It's never wrong to push yourselves, that's why, when I'm done with this project and I still have some time left, I'd like to implement the following features:
* Difficulty settings:
  * Easy = Lets the player win every time
  * Medium = Randomizes the computer's cards so it's an honest game
  * Hard = The computer will win every time
  * Besart = Play against a highly trained and refined AI that will play this game in the exact same manner as Besart himself would (he always picks rock)

##  When in doubt, Write it out:
What I want the Javascript code to do is:
* When the user clicks the "Rock" button, to put in that "Rock" value in the function that will be used to play the game.
* To create a function that generates a random value from Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock
* The biggest IF function that I will have made up to this point, with every IF function being worded like: if (userpick = rock) {}

This is the way I will be tackling this issue for now, this however can change once I discover an easier/more fun way to achieve the result I desire.
